# Hi, I'm MaroÅ¡! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a react frontend developer working on my skills everyday.


## ðŸ›  Skills
Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, SQL (Postgre/Mysql), Prisma ORM


## Lessons Learned

By building this project i've practiced Typescript and learned how to connect backend to frontend with Prisma ORM. 
It was tough task and backend is area i know least about, i faced many issues, even small as using POSTGRESS instead of POSTGRES which prevented me from
connecting my db to frontend, but i've managed to resolve them and create functional full-stack app.
